1. Top 7 Metrics:
    - Most used agent
    - Duration vs status vs cost
    - peak time (most active hours)
    - cost vs time analysis
    - interruptions analysis (is there any relation between the agent and number of interruptions)
    - average LLM and TTS latency (graphs) 
    - Total and Average call cost per agent

2. Filters to split the data
    - agent type (ID)
    - call type: inbound / outbound
    - cost (large, medium, small)
    - status type
    - specific (from number) / (to number) call details
    - high latency data

3. Visualization suggestions
    - Most active agent: bar chart
    - Duration and status: 
    - cost per agent: bar chart
    - Peak call hours: line chart
    - interruption frequency (agent wise pie chart)
    - LLM/TTS latency agent specific over the hours
    - 


4. To have insights more accessible and actionable
    - we can provide monthly summery and suggestions how they can optimize
    - allow some sort of the filter creation (some sort of sql or so, they can create there own filters)
    (this two will be more then enough)
